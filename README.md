# Dogshit Low Effort Dotfiles

Hi, I see you are here, welcome to my dotfiles, they are not so good but provides everything I need :). Ofcourse as the name, the effort in these dotfiles is significantly low, and it's filled with weird idiotic hacks, but *trust me you won't notice them.* <br>

## **Summary**

#### ~~Sponsored~~ Spoonfeeded By:
- 27 Cups of coffee! (As of 10th Jan 2022)
### **Stuff:**
- ArchLinux as a distro, *but bloated*  
- ZSH as shell, *more bloated than yo momma*   
- XFCE as Desktop Environment   
- Alacritty as the terminal   
- Picom as the compositor, *with a shit config*   
- Rofi as launcher  
- Inter as font
- EWW and Conky as widgets!
- Deadd notification center as notification daemon and center

## Wanna use it? Lets do this

The folders in the `.config` directory are actual dotfiles, so you copy them into your "/home/`<username>`/.config" folder and edit them according to your needs.
 
#### Just make sure to:
- Edit the `API_KEY` and the `CITY_ID` in conky to get the weather stuff working, it is located in `~/.config/conky/Kochab/scripts/weather.sh`. You can get one key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Make sure to edit the EWW widgets for your name, username and hostname to be displayed. They can be edited in `~/.config/eww/structs/main-utils/user/user.yuck`.

#### Done? Neat!

This is our MacOS like Appmenu in the top panel, see [Vala Panel Appmenu](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-panel-appmenu). Make sure to install the XFCE version.  
After you install the XFCE Appmenu, make sure to run the below commands to enable it:
